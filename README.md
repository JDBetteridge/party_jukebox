# Jack's Spotify Jukebox

Has some dependencies like, errr

```
Flask
requests
requests-oauthlib
```

I will add a full `requirements.txt` once confirmed

To run just:

```
python party_jukebox.py
```

This starts a Flask application.

Then point your browser at

```
127.0.0.1:6500
```

to login to your spotify acount and use the jukebox.

Party guests will also access the application via the ip of the host computer.
